## __Description__
D&I Assist is a fully responsive static HTML and CSS website designed to provide a basic understanding of diversity and inclusion, along with guidance on implementing changes in the workplace or educational settings.


### __Primary Users__
- Work roles related to D&I
- Managers, Senior team members
- Educators


### __Primary Users Journeys__
- User can read and understand further information on D&I best practices
at work or school, depending on which product is most relevant
- User can see quick hints and tips for better D&I processes
- User can register for D&I White Paper (value acquisition tool)

### __Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria__

Can be found in the project board here: [Project Board](https://github.com/users/msaunders4-bc/projects/3)


## __Design Documentation__

### __Wireframes__
Some basic wireframes were created to help visualise the final product. Both mobile and desktop wireframes were developed.

 ### __Colour Palette__
![Colour palette](/assets/images/Flagstone1-colour%20palette.png) !

This palette was selected as I feel it gives the site a feel of trust and authority. The colour contrast allows for a good score in terms of accessibility, with a professional finish.

### __Topography__
- Noto-sans font was used throughout for consistency. Noto-sans is considered a calm but business focussed font. Something I aim this website to encapsulate.

### __Image generation__
Images are all stock images free to downloaded and use from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

I chose to use pictures as the subject is all about people in either work or school. The pictures enable the website to show a professional apprach, and gives the user an idea of what the website offers (D&I advice)




## __Building the website__

### __Technologies Used__
- HTML
- CSS

### __How AI Was Used__

AI played its part in the development of this project. Here are some ways AI was used:

- __User stories and acceptance criteria__
    - Copilot was used to ideate additional user stories and refine the acceptance criteria.


- __Code Generation__
    - AI tools co-pilot and chatGPT were used for help when needing to debug the website. 
    - AI used to generate boilerplate lists and cards for efficiency.
    - Some code snippets were used from VS code co-pilot recommendations.



### __Core Features of the website__
 - Scrollable main page alolowing a user to find relevant information on D&I overall including key principles and hints&tips
 - Cards for each D&I product - work place and schools - allowing a user to action and find more information on a specific product in a new page
 - Easy registratiion form, used alongside a value acquisition tool being a whitepaper, allowing a user to register their details in return for the doc.
 - Contact and social links clear for any follow-up or to keep up to date


### __Features left to Implement__
 - Should Have: Centre align Header content on screens >1200px
 - Should Have: imagery on the secondary pages - at-work and at-school
 - Should Have: multilingual capability - as this is a Inclusion focussed site
 - Could Have: Intro video on the main page
